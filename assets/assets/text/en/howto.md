# How to solve puzzles 

Here you will find brief instructions on how to proceed in solving tasks, puzzles and ciphers. They are for your amusement, they contain only one form of "encrypting" the keyword (it is usually one word or number). It is not necessary to enter accents or uppercase / lowercase letters. If you don't know how to solve the puzzle after a while, try the help or you can skip the task. The task is usually related to where you are or part of the story from the application. Sometimes it requires general knowledge or knowledge of the matter (e.g. movies), the Internet can be of help here.

# Basic forms of encryption:
## A. Alphabet - letter shifting in the alphabet

* Shift letters in the alphabet by a fixed number of characters (e.g. 1 .. i.e. A = B, B = C, etc.)
* Shift letters in the alphabet by a variable number of characters (eg the first character is shifted by 1, the next by 2, etc.)
* Shift of letters in the alphabet based on a repeating key (the BOBR key means a shift of 1, 14, 1, 17) - see table 1

## B. Alphabet - conversion to numbers

An English alphabet of 26 characters is used as a basis. The letter CH is not used. As a representation of letters we use a number series from 1-26, see the table below.

|  A |  B |  C |  D |  E |  F |  G |  H |  I |
|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|
|  1 |  2 |  3 |  4 |  5 |  6 |  7 |  8 |  9 |

| J |  K |  L |  M  | N |  O | 
|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|
| 10 | 11 | 12 | 13 |14 | 15 | 

| P |  Q |  R |  S |  T |  U | 
|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|
|16 | 17 | 18 | 19 | 20 | 21 | 

 |V |  W |  X |  Y |  Z |
 |:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|
 |22 | 23 | 24 | 25 | 26 |
 
## C. Alphabet - text masking

Unlike the previous ones, this method is not about moving the letters, but about masking them in the text, e.g.:

* Omitting letters
* Add extra letters
* Shifting spaces
* Uppercase / lowercase letters
* Text backwards
* Skipping letters between lines

## D. Alphabet - Polish Cross

Convert letters to characters in the form of a "phone keypad"

|ABC	|DEF	|GHI |
|:-----:|:-----:|:----:|
|JKL	|MNO	|PQR|
|STU	|VWX	|YZ|

## E. Coding

### Morse code

* The length of the dot is one unit
* Commas are three units
* The space between parts of the same letter is one unit
* The space between letters in three units
* The space between words is seven units

The Morse code can be represented graphically, symbols, letters (e.g. consonant / vowel) or otherwise.

### Braille

The font was invented for the visually impaired and blind for tactile reading, the base is a rectangle with six points, and can be used for encryption, for example, for graphic masking.

## F. Graphic Ciphers

The principle of graphic ciphers is to hide the message / letters in the image, e.g. with coordinates, the first letters of image names and many others. Name what you see in the picture and try different principles. Ciphers and tasks usually have something to do with the place or part of the story that is in the application.
